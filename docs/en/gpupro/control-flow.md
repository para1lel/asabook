TIRx provides `if`, several loop forms, and `while`. Each maps directly to the
corresponding CUDA control flow.

if
--

A Python `if` / `else` becomes a CUDA `if` / `else`. Guard work by a
thread/lane comparison, or elect a single issuing thread with
`T.ptx.elect_sync()`:

```python
if tx < 128:
  A[tx] = A[tx] * T.float32(2.0)
else:
  A[tx] = A[tx] + T.float32(1.0)

if T.ptx.elect_sync():
  ...                              # one elected lane (e.g. to issue TMA/MMA)
```

```c++
if (((int)threadIdx.x) < 128) {
  A_ptr[tx] = A_ptr[tx] * 2.0f;
} else {
  A_ptr[tx] = A_ptr[tx] + 1.0f;
}
```

For an expression-level choice without an explicit TIRx control-flow branch, use
`T.if_then_else(cond, a, b)`. It lowers to a ternary expression; the backend
still decides which machine instructions implement that expression:

```c++
O_ptr[tx] = (A_ptr[tx] > 0.0f) ? A_ptr[tx] : 0.0f;
```

## Uniform vs. divergent control flow

Per-thread guards such as `if tx < 128` are fine for ordinary work, but
**collective** operations must be reached *uniformly* by every thread they
synchronize. 

For example, `T.cuda.cta_sync()` maps to `__syncthreads()`, which requires all
threads in the thread block. It must never sit inside a thread- or
warpgroup-divergent branch: if placed inside `if wg_id == 0:`, the other
warpgroups will never arrive and the kernel will deadlock. When only one warpgroup
needs to synchronize, use a warpgroup-scoped `T.cuda.warpgroup_sync(id)` (see
[Scaling GEMM with Warp Specialization and Clusters](/en/gpupro/warp-specialized-gemm/) and [CUDA C++/PTX Intrinsics](/en/gpupro/cuda-ptx-intrinsics/)). 

The same caution applies to barrier setup. The high-level `MBarrier.init()`
wrapper emits a single-thread guard (`if (threadIdx.x < 1)`). Nesting that call
inside another divergent branch can leave the barrier uninitialized and cause an
unspecified launch failure. The raw `T.ptx.mbarrier.init` intrinsic does not add
this guard automatically; its caller must select the initializing thread.

## loop

Loops come in four flavors; a plain Python `range` becomes `T.serial`:

- `T.serial(n)` — a sequential loop (ptxas may still unroll it).
- `T.unroll(n)` — fully unrolled (expanded to straight-line statements).
- `T.vectorized(n)` — a vectorized loop.
- `T.grid(*extents)` — a nested loop nest.

`break` / `continue` work inside loops.

```python
for i, j in T.grid(8, 8):
  B[i, j] = T.max(A[i, j], T.float32(0.0))
```

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
  for (int j = 0; j < 8; ++j)
    B_ptr[i * 8 + j] = max(A_ptr[i * 8 + j], 0.0f);
```

`T.unroll(4)` instead expands to four straight-line statements with no loop.

## while

A `while` loop runs until its condition is false. Use a mutable scalar counter
(see [Buffers and Memory](/en/gpupro/buffers-and-memory/)):

```python
i: T.int32 = 0
while i < 64:
  A[i] = A[i] + T.float32(1.0)
  i += 1
```

It lowers to a `while (1)` with an early-exit `break` (the counter is a
one-element register buffer):

```c++
int i_ptr[1];
i_ptr[0] = 0;
while (1) {
  if (!(i_ptr[0] < 64)) { break; }
  A_ptr[i_ptr[0]] = A_ptr[i_ptr[0]] + 1.0f;
  i_ptr[0] = i_ptr[0] + 1;
}
```
